        Legal thingy text and also some very legal stuff about how if everything goes shit we are not
        responsible for anything ok. And then many other things that I don\'t know because I\'m studying
        informatics and not law for a reason. And since people should be able to read this text even if
        they are like almost blind, the text size should be bigger right? Well, let\'s put it at 10dp.
        Damn, that\'s even smaller than the default text size; let\'s try 20dp. Or better, 20sp, since the
        auto corrector said that for text sizes it would be better to use sp and not dp. Yep, 20 is indeed
        better. But let\'s add some padding.
        But seriously, this app should never be used when not related to emergencies. The cost of the calls is borne by the caller and the rates may vary. Not all numbers are free. This application only facilitates the search of the emergency numbers with your location. Its proper functioning depends on the network coverage and your phone carrier.
